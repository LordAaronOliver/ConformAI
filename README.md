## 🚨 Call to Builders: Help Launch ConformAI – A Free, Open-Source Planning and Development Navigator

**Target Launch: October 2025 | Global, Volunteer-Powered, Human-First**

Hi, I’m Aaron – just an everyday Aussie with a big dream and zero funding, but an unshakable belief in the power of open-source AI to do real, tangible good for real people.

I'm building **ConformAI** — a free, open-source, web-based AI tool that empowers homeowners, renovators, rural entrepreneurs, and developers to **navigate planning and development laws** in their region with confidence, speed, and clarity.

### 🧱 What It Does:

* **Turns your postcode into a local planning assistant** by sourcing relevant laws, regulations, and compliance steps.
* Helps generate **application-ready documents** using natural language prompts.
* Optimizes for **any country or region** by swapping out legal databases and governance structures.
* **Supports rural micro-developments** as much as urban expansions.
* Stays **100% free, open, and modifiable** for public use.

### 🌍 Why It Matters:

Getting permits to build a shed, open a small farmstay, or develop a local food co-op shouldn't require a law degree. Yet across the globe, **barriers to entry for small-scale, sustainable development are suffocating innovation** and livelihoods — especially in regional communities.

**ConformAI exists to fix that.**

But right now, I’ve only just finished part 1 of step 1. I need help turning this plan into reality by October 2025.

## 👷 Who I Need

I’m looking for like-minded volunteers who believe in:

* **Accessible AI for everyone**
* **Reducing red tape for good**
* **Community-driven tech that empowers, not profits off, people**

### Needed Roles:

* 🧠 **AI/ML developers** (LLM integration, fine-tuning, prompt engineering)
* 🌐 **Full-stack web developers** (React, Node.js, Tailwind, Supabase/Firebase)
* 🗂️ **Data engineers** (Scraping & structuring local/state/national laws)
* 📜 **Legal/urban planning advisors** (for structuring inputs/outputs)
* 📢 **Content/UX/UI designers** (to make this usable by non-tech folks)
* 🧪 **Testers** — ideally people like me trying to start small, local projects

---

## 🔧 Tech Vision

Think of ConformAI like a civic ChatGPT, but focused purely on navigating **planning laws and development compliance** — adaptive by location, fully open-source, and built with public benefit, not profit, in mind.

---

## 🌱 Why Volunteer?

* You're not building yet another app to optimise ad delivery — you’re building something that helps **actual people** get real things done.
* Your work will help someone like me start a small business, feed a family, or build a community hub.
* This is your chance to help shape an open-source civic infrastructure tool that could **serve millions**, starting small but thinking global.

Let’s build something that makes governments work *for* people again — one regulation at a time.
